# Notes
- I used SOLID, DRY, KISS principles
- I decompose functionality by modules and tried to keep them as simple as possible
- I used idea http client for testing API
- I used Postman for API developement by can't share it because it's not free
- I skip some e2e tests because I don't have enough time

# Ideas
Possible improvements:
- add more e2e for all controllers
- add tests for all services
- moved sql queries to separate repository file type (e.g. balances.repository.js)
- add dto for all controllers
- add validation for all dto
